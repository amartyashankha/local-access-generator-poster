    %\item [] \textbf{Bounding the number of re-samplings:}
    \item Divide each row of the adjacency matrix into contiguous buckets
    \item Expected number of neighbors in a bucket is $\Theta(\log n)$
    \item Each vertex $v$ is associated with buckets $ \langle B^v_1, B^v_2, B^v_3,\cdots\rangle$
    \item An \textbf{unfilled} bucket may contain some indirectly exposed neighbors
    \item A \textbf{filled} bucket will contain every possible sampled neighbor

\begin{alertblock}{Filling the $i^{th}$ bucket $B^v_i$ of vertex $v$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use skip-sampling to produce a \textbf{potential} \emph{next-neighbor} $u$ of $v$ in $B^v_i$
    \item Check if $(u, v)$ was set to $0$, by looking at bucket $\mathcal B$ of $u$ containing $v$
    \item If so, re-sample. Otherwise, mark $u$ as a neighbor of $v$, and update $\mathcal B$
    \item W.h.p, only $\mathcal O(\log^2 n)$ \textbf{potential} neighbors are generated in $B^v_i$
    %\item With high probability, none of the buckets contain zero neighbors.

    \item [] \textbf{Degree Sampling:} Sampling the degree of $v$ seems to be much harder
    \item Sampling $deg(v)$ conditions the remaining RVs in very non-trivial ways
    \item However, we can stil sample a random neighbor (with prob. $1/deg(v)$)

\begin{alertblock}{$\textsc{Random-Neighbor}(v)$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose a random bucket $\mathcal B$ of $v$. If the $\mathcal B$ is \textbf{unfilled}, fill it.
    \item If $k$ neighbors found in $\mathcal B$, start over (reject) with probability $1-k/M$.
    \item If accepted, return an uniformly random neighbor found in $\mathcal B$.
\end{itemize}
For $M = \mathcal O(\log^2 N)$, the max number of neighbors in any bucket is $<M$.
So, the number of rejection sampling rounds is $\mathcal O(\log^2 N)$ in expectation.
