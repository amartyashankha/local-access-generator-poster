\begin{block}{Trivial Example - Sampling $G(n, p)$}

\textbf{Model:} Undirected graph on $N$ vertices (numbered $\langle 1, 2, 3, \cdots, N\rangle$),
where each edge exists with prob. $p$.

\textbf{Partial Sample:} Given vertices $u, v$, is $(u,v)\in E$?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Just a collection of $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ Bernoulli RVs with bias $p$.
    \item Given $u, v$, sample a single Bernoulli if neither $(u,v)$ not $(v,u)$ has been sampled yet.
          Otherwise return the previously sampled value.
\end{itemize}

\end{block}

\begin{block}{Find Next-Neighbor (\emph{skip-sampling})}

\textbf{Adjacency List query:} Return neighbors of $v$ in order.
$$
\mathbb P[k \textrm{ non-neighbors before next-neighbor}] = (1-p)^k\cdot p
$$
We can sample from this distribution in $\tilde{\mathcal O}(1)$ time [cite].
Essentially, we avoid sampling each $0$ separately.

\textbf{Issue:} Adjacency matrix is symmetric. So, each zero must also appear in the corresponding column of $v$.

If the sampled neighbor is a $0$, discard and resample.

\textbf{Cannot afford too many re-samplings.}
